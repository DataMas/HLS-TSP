<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The repository includes an implementation of Genetic Algorithm solving the Traveling Salesman Problem for High Level Synthesis.

The project was implemented for the purposes of the Hardware Design for High Level Synthesis course of the 9th semester of DUTh.

This repo contains 2 branches:
- *software*: Contains the developed C++ code that can be run locally in any IDE.
- *hardware*: Contains the developed C++ code adjusted for Catapult HLS tool.

Apart from random graphs, the algorithm can be tested for the SGB128 (North American cities) dataset created by Stanford. To visualize the solution, run the notebook.
